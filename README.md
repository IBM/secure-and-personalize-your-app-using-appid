# Add Security and User Personalization for your application using AppID

There are two important aspects for any applications that you build - `Authentication and User Personalization`. 

If you take authentication on online platforms, the support for `Social login` is common now. The users can login to the online portal using their Google or Facebook accounts. This method of authentication is beneficial both for online portals and end users. There is increased consumption and usability as there is no need to create a separate account on every online portal for authentication. The trust in the security provided by social media login has been increasing too. 

The second aspect is user personalization. Many online portals have vast amount of information. The end user is interested only in certain areas of the information. User personalization can make the portal more consumable for an end user. Let us take the example of a online news portal. The news can be from the area of Politics, Entertainment, Science, Technology, Sports or Finance. An end user who is interested in Sports will have to filter through many articles before reading the article of interest. Here, user personalization can do the filtering task and present articles in the end users areas of interest.

In this code pattern, you will build an online financial news portal with social login and user personalization with AppID. The news portal will source articles from `Discovery News` collection. The end user can log in using their existing Google or Facebook accounts. After login, the user builds a profile specifying the areas of interest like Equity, Mutual Funds etc. The application filters the news content based on user profile and presents it to the end user for consumption.

When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:
* Add social login to an application with AppID
* Build user profile with AppID
* Get financial news from discovery news collection using Discovery query language
* Add user personalization to filter news articles based on user profile
